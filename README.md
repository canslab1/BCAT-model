# A Mixed Opinion Dynamics and Innovation Diffusion Model for Exploring the ‘Best Game No One Played’ Phenomenon

## Abstract
Innovative products receiving favorable reviews but never catching on with consumers are known as “the best game no one played.” We combined an adoption threshold model with an opinion dynamics model to examine why certain high-quality products and ideas never achieve expected levels of success. Most studies using opinion dynamics models focus on opinion exchanges without discussing follow-up actions. Most that use adoption threshold models only examine ways that individual decisions depend on proportions of friends and neighbors already engaged in specific behaviors, regardless of opinion differences. Regular lattice, random, small-world and scale-free networks were used as underlying social structures for agent-based simulations designed to analyze opinion exchange dynamics and product or idea acceptance. Results indicate that computational agents were capable of changing pro/con opinions about products and ideas when communicating with neighboring agents, and of making acceptance/rejection choices based on individual adoption thresholds plus observations of neighboring agent behaviors. Sensitivity analysis simulation experiments were performed to determine which factors exerted the greatest influence or required the greatest care when applied to cases of innovation diffusion. Agent adoption threshold mean exerted the strongest influence, followed by agent attitude mean and bounded confidence.
